## Getting Started

All you have to do to run this program is download the files, run the Main.java file. THe program runs on the terminal, since I havent mastered how to actually create windows in Java.

Other than that I hope you enjoy, and I'm more than welcome to anyone wanting to look at the code, and giving me tips on how to make it better. Enjoy!!

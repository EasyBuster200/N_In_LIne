## Overview

This is a very simple game of connect 4 with the twist that the user can decide how big the board actually is and how many chips are actually need in a row to win (meaning its actually a connect n).
I developed this fully on my own, and I'm still finding more and more ways to improve both in efficiency and adding more features.

## Getting Started

All you have to do to run this program is download the files, run the Main.java file. The program runs on the terminal, since I havent mastered how to actually create windows in Java.

Other than that I hope you enjoy, and I'm more than welcome to anyone wanting to look at the code, and giving me tips on how to make it better. Enjoy!!
